# FS MAR-15 Movie Trailer Website Project

The project showcases some of my favorite movies.

Each movie is displayed with its corresponding movie poster. Underneath, it shows:
* Title
* Year of release
* MPAA rating
* Duration in minutes

I added a footer at the bottom, which has Twitter and LinkedIn contact buttons. Clicking the twitter logo will bring up a tweet box you can use to send me a message. Clicking on the LinkedIn logo will bring you to my LinkedIn profile.

### Steps to successfully run the application:
* Go to: https://github.com/ronFloyd/movie_trailer_website
* Click on 'Download ZIP'
* Unzip
* Navigate to movies/entertainment_center.py
* Right-click on entertainment_center.py and open with IDLE (2.7.9)
* In the IDLE menu bar at the top, click on 'Run' and select 'Run Module'

Enjoy!
