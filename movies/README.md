# FS MAR-15 Movie Trailer Website Project

The project showcases some of my favorite movies.

Each movie is displayed with its corresponding movie poster. Underneath, it shows:
* Title
* Year of release
* MPAA rating
* Duration in minutes

I added a footer at the bottom, which has Twitter and LinkedIn contact buttons. Clicking the twitter logo will bring up a tweet box you can use to send me a message. Clicking on the LinkedIn logo will bring you to my LinkedIn profile.

Enjoy!
